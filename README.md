## Break is over, but not for you...
It was just another day for Terry at *Snowballas Snowball ManUfactoring for U*. 
Lunch ended, and it is time to get back to the grind. 
Terry needs to climb the mountain to get back to the company snowball machine... 
but Terry's coworker, Dankey Kang, already turned it on!

Dodge snowballs to get to the top of the mountain and discover hidden secrets in... **DANKEY KANG'S DECEMBER**.
